This is a mini vs code using vanilla js. it allawys you to edit code such as the original. terminal to run your js, browser to view your html and css. you can also code with other people in real time. it is a great tool for web development.

purpose: i wanted to code in vanilla and get more comfortable with it, i was curuios about the state managment in vs code, more refreshing than the normla crud app we do every where and more complex.
